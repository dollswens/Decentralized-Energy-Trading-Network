# Decentralized Energy Trading Network - Smart Contracts

## Overview

This PR introduces a set of Clarity smart contracts designed to create a Decentralized Energy Trading Network. The system aims to facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading, track energy production, manage grid stability, and integrate carbon offset mechanisms.

## New Contracts

### 1. Energy Production Tracking Contract (`energy-production-tracking.clar`)

- Registers energy producers
- Records energy generation from various sources
- Tracks total energy production over time

Key functions:
- `register-producer`: Register a new energy producer
- `record-energy-production`: Record energy production for a producer
- `get-producer-info`: Retrieve information about a producer
- `get-energy-production`: Get the total energy production for a producer

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Trading Contract (`peer-to-peer-trading.clar`)

- Creates energy trading offers
- Matches buyers and sellers
- Executes energy trades
- Settles payments

Key functions:
- `create-energy-offer`: Create a new energy offer
- `accept-energy-offer`: Accept an existing energy offer
- `cancel-energy-offer`: Cancel an energy offer
- `get-energy-offer`: Retrieve details of an energy offer
- `get-energy-balance`: Get the energy balance of an address

### 3. Grid Management Contract (`grid-management.clar`)

- Monitors grid stability
- Manages energy distribution
- Handles peak load balancing
- Implements emergency protocols

Key functions:
- `update-grid-status`: Update the current grid status
- `set-operator-authorization`: Authorize or deauthorize grid operators
- `implement-emergency-protocol`: Activate emergency measures
- `get-current-grid-status`: Retrieve the current grid status
- `is-authorized-operator`: Check if an address is an authorized operator

### 4. Carbon Offset Integration Contract (`carbon-offset-integration.clar`)

- Links clean energy production to carbon credits
- Issues carbon credits for clean energy generation
- Allows trading of carbon credits
- Tracks carbon offset achievements

Key functions:
- `register-clean-energy-producer`: Register a clean energy producer
- `issue-carbon-credits`: Issue carbon credits to a producer
- `transfer-carbon-credits`: Transfer carbon credits between addresses
- `get-carbon-credits-balance`: Get the carbon credit balance of an address
- `is-clean-energy-producer`: Check if an address is a registered clean energy producer

## Testing

Each contract is accompanied by a test file using Vitest:

- `energy-production-tracking.test.ts`
- `peer-to-peer-trading.test.ts`
- `grid-management.test.ts`
- `carbon-offset-integration.test.ts`

These tests outline the expected behavior of each contract function, providing a framework for implementing actual contract calls in a test environment.

## Benefits

1. **Decentralized Energy Trading**: Enables direct peer-to-peer energy transactions.
2. **Transparent Production Tracking**: Provides clear records of energy generation.
3. **Grid Stability**: Ensures reliable energy distribution and management.
4. **Carbon Offset Integration**: Incentivizes clean energy production through carbon credits.

## Use Cases

- Microgrids and community energy projects
- Renewable energy incentive programs
- Smart city energy management
- Carbon credit markets for individuals and businesses

## Next Steps

1. Review and merge these contracts into the main codebase.
2. Implement a user interface for interacting with these contracts.
3. Conduct thorough testing, including edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.
4. Integrate with IoT devices for real-time energy production and consumption data.
5. Develop documentation and guides for energy producers, consumers, and grid operators.

This Decentralized Energy Trading Network provides a robust foundation for creating a more efficient, transparent, and sustainable energy ecosystem. It empowers individuals and businesses to participate directly in the energy market while promoting clean energy production and responsible consumption.
